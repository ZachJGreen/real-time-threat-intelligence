# Summary of NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 and Risk Management Framework (RMF)

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** provides organizations guidance on how to manage cybersecurity risks. This guidance applies to any organization, regardless of size. It outlines high-level cybersecurity outcomes without prescribing specific solutions, allowing flexibility based on an organization's needs.

### Key Components:
- **CSF Core**: A breakdown of cybersecurity outcomes with labels:
  - **Functions**: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
  - **Categories & Subcategories**: Descriptions of cybersecurity goals within each function.
- **CSF Profiles**: Used to understand and tailor the Core’s goals based on the organization’s requirements.
- **CSF Tiers**: Used to rank an organization's capabilities in dealing with and preventing cybersecurity incidents.

### Main Benefits:
- **Scalability & Flexibility**: Adaptable to various industries, technologies, and organizational sizes.
- **Integration with Risk Management**: Organizations can use suitable tools to address their unique ICT risks.
- **Guidance & Resources**: Provides extensive guidance and links to up-to-date and relevant resources.

CSF 2.0 introduces **stronger governance integration** and **supply chain security** considerations while maintaining a **non-prescriptive, outcome-based approach**.

## Risk Management Framework (RMF)

The **Risk Management Framework (RMF)**, outlined in **NIST Special Publication 800-37 Rev. 2**, provides a structured process for integrating security and privacy into information systems throughout their **entire life cycle**. It aligns with **CSF 2.0**, incorporates **privacy risk management**, and supports **supply chain risk management**.

### Key Features:
- **Lifecycle Approach**: RMF applies risk management throughout a system’s life cycle, from initial implementation to continuous monitoring.
- **Integration with Governance**: Aligns with organizational mission objectives and strategic risk tolerance.
- **Automation & Efficiency**: Encourages automation in security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring.

### RMF Process (7 Steps):
1. **Prepare**: Define roles and responsibilities and establish priorities for managing security and privacy risks.
2. **Categorize**: Identify system assets, data, and their impact in case of a security breach.
3. **Select**: Choose security and privacy controls tailored to reducing risk.
4. **Implement**: Deploy selected controls from the previous step.
5. **Assess**: Evaluate the effectiveness of implemented controls.
6. **Authorize**: Determine if the risk level is acceptable within the organization's objectives.
7. **Monitor**: Continuously assess and update security posture based on new threats and requirements.

Although the process is listed in steps, **RMF is not necessarily sequential**—organizations should revisit steps as needed.

### Main Benefits:
- **Risk Management**: Integrates cybersecurity, privacy, and supply chain risk.
- **Support for All Organizations**: Initially designed for government use, but adaptable to all organizations.
- **Roles and Responsibilities Guidance**: Provides clear guidance on risk management roles and responsibilities.

## Comparison of CSF 2.0 & RMF

| **Feature**           | **CSF 2.0**                                  | **RMF**                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | High-level cybersecurity risk management framework | Detailed risk management process for systems |
| **Approach**        | Non-prescriptive, adaptable to various industries | Structured, process-driven, lifecycle-based |
| **Focus Areas**     | Governance, risk prioritization, supply chain security | Security & privacy integration, continuous monitoring |
| **Applicability**   | Organizations of all sizes | Primarily for IT systems, particularly in government |
| **Implementation Guidance** | High-level outcomes, references to best practices | Specific steps, control selection, and authorization |
| **Use Case**        | Strategic decision-making for cybersecurity | Tactical execution of cybersecurity controls |

## Conclusion

CSF 2.0 is a **high-level, flexible framework** designed to help organizations **understand, prioritize, and manage cybersecurity risks** without enforcing specific solutions. In contrast, RMF is a **detailed, process-oriented framework** aimed at **system-level security and privacy risk management**. 

Both frameworks complement each other:
- **CSF provides strategic guidance** on cybersecurity risk management.
- **RMF ensures tactical security implementation and compliance**.

Organizations can use CSF 2.0 for **broad cybersecurity governance** and RMF for **system-specific security controls and risk assessments**.
