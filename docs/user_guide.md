## Introduction

The Real-Time Threat Intelligence (RTTI) platform is a comprehensive security solution designed for blue team analysts to monitor, detect, assess, and respond to cybersecurity threats in real-time. This guide will help security analysts navigate the platform effectively.

> **Note on Current Development Status:** This guide describes the intended functionality of the RTTI platform, including both implemented features and planned enhancements. Features marked with "Future Enhancement" or similar notes are planned for implementation in upcoming releases.

### Key Features
- Real-time threat monitoring and detection
- Dynamic risk scoring and prioritization 
- Automated threat mitigation recommendations
- Cost-benefit analysis for security controls
- Incident response planning
- Alert management

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Network access to the RTTI server
- Authentication credentials

### Accessing the Platform
1. Navigate to `https://rtti.shopsmart.com` in your web browser
2. Enter your username and password
3. Use multi-factor authentication if configured
4. You will be directed to the main dashboard upon successful login

> **Note:** Role-based access control and authentication features are planned for future implementation. Currently, the system does not enforce login requirements or role-based permissions.

### User Roles
- **Administrator**: Full access to all features and configuration settings
- **Security Analyst**: Access to threat intelligence, alerts, and incident response
- **Executive**: Access to high-level reports and summaries only

> **Future Enhancement:** These role-based access controls will be implemented in a future update.

## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your security posture:

### Dashboard Components
1. **Risk Summary**: Displays high-risk threats and average risk score
2. **Asset Exposure**: Shows affected assets and protection rate
3. **Recent Activity**: Lists recent security events and actions
4. **Top Threats**: Table of highest-risk threats sorted by risk score

> **Note:** The dashboard is currently implemented with core functionality. Some visualizations like charts and graphs for risk trends are planned for future updates.

### Navigation
Use the tabs at the top of the dashboard to navigate between different views:
- **Overview**: Main dashboard with summary information
- **Threat Log**: Detailed log of all detected threats
- **Risk Analysis**: Tools for analyzing and scoring threats
- **Alerts**: Active security alerts requiring attention

## Threat Intelligence

The Threat Intelligence section provides detailed information about detected threats.

### Viewing Threat Logs
1. Click the "Threat Log" tab on the dashboard
2. Use filters to narrow down threats by type, asset, or severity
3. Sort the table by clicking on column headers
4. Click on any threat to view detailed information

### Understanding Threat Data
Each threat entry includes:
- **Threat Name**: Type of threat detected
- **Asset**: Affected system or component
- **Vulnerability**: Specific weakness being exploited
- **Likelihood**: Probability of successful exploitation (1-5)
- **Impact**: Potential damage if exploited (1-5)
- **Risk Score**: Calculated as Likelihood × Impact (1-25)

### Exporting Threat Data
To export threat data for reporting or further analysis:
1. Apply desired filters to show relevant threats
2. Click the "Generate CSV" button
3. Save the file to your desired location

## Risk Assessment

The RTTI platform uses a sophisticated risk scoring model to prioritize threats.

### Risk Score Calculation
Risk scores are calculated using the formula:
```
Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact × Decay Factor
```

Where:
- **Likelihood**: Probability of successful exploitation (1-5)
- **Impact**: Potential damage if exploited (1-5)
- **Decay Factor**: Reduces risk over time for older threats

### Risk Levels
Threats are categorized by risk level:
- **Critical** (20-25): Immediate action required
- **High** (15-19): Urgent action needed
- **Medium** (10-14): Action recommended
- **Low** (1-9): Monitor and reassess regularly

### Analyzing Individual Threats
To analyze a specific threat:
1. Click on the threat entry in the Threat Log
2. Review detailed information including OSINT data
3. Check the AI-driven analysis for insights
4. View recommended mitigation strategies

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

The Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) tool helps evaluate security controls.

### Performing a CBA
1. Navigate to the "Risk Analysis" tab
2. Select a threat from the dropdown menu
3. Enter the asset value ($)
4. Click "Analyze Security Controls"

### Interpreting CBA Results
The analysis provides key metrics for each security control:
- **Initial Risk**: Expected financial loss before mitigation
- **Residual Risk**: Expected loss after mitigation
- **Risk Reduction**: Amount of risk reduced
- **Control Cost**: Annual cost of implementing the control
- **Net Benefit**: Financial benefit of implementing the control
- **ROI**: Return on investment as a percentage
- **Recommendation**: Whether to implement the control

### Using CBA for Decision Making
- Controls with positive ROI are typically recommended
- Higher ROI indicates more cost-effective controls
- Consider implementing controls with the highest ROI first
- Factor in implementation timeframes and resource requirements

## Incident Response

When a threat is detected, the platform provides structured incident response guidance.

### Accessing Response Plans
1. From a threat detail view, click "View Response Plan"
2. Or access from the alert management screen
3. Choose automatic or manual response options

### Automated Responses
The system can automatically implement responses for certain threats:
- **Firewall Rule Updates**: Block malicious IPs
- **Account Lockouts**: Secure compromised accounts
- **Service Protection**: Enable rate limiting

> **Note:** Currently, automated IP blocking is implemented. Account lockouts and automatic service protection features are planned for future releases.

### Manual Response Steps
For threats requiring manual intervention, follow the provided steps:
1. **Containment**: Instructions to limit the threat's spread
2. **Eradication**: Steps to remove the threat
3. **Recovery**: Procedures to restore normal operations
4. **Lessons Learned**: Template for post-incident review

## Alert Management

The Alerts tab displays active security alerts requiring attention.

### Alert Types
- **Critical Alerts**: High-risk threats requiring immediate action
- **High Risk Alerts**: Serious threats requiring urgent attention
- **System Alerts**: Notifications about system health or configuration

### Responding to Alerts
1. Review the alert details
2. Click "Acknowledge" to indicate you're investigating
3. Follow the recommended response steps
4. Click "Resolve" once the issue is addressed

### Creating Test Alerts
For training or testing purposes:
1. Click "Create Test Alert" 
2. Enter threat name and risk score
3. Add a description if desired
4. Click "Create"

## Advanced Features

### AI-Powered Threat Hunting
The platform includes AI capabilities to detect unknown threats:
1. Navigate to the "Advanced" tab
2. Click "Start Threat Hunting"
3. Review AI-detected anomalies
4. Confirm or dismiss findings

> **Note:** The AI-powered threat hunting feature is currently in a basic implementation stage. Advanced anomaly detection capabilities are planned for future releases.

### Blue Team Defense Automation
Automated defensive measures include:
1. **Dynamic Firewall Rules**: Automatically block malicious traffic
2. **Vulnerability Patching**: Prioritize and deploy critical patches
3. **Configuration Hardening**: Apply secure configurations

> **Note:** While basic defense automation is implemented, advanced features like vulnerability patching and configuration hardening are planned for future releases. Currently, IP blocking for malicious actors is the primary automated defense mechanism.

### Customizing Defensive Responses
To customize automatic responses:
1. Go to "Settings" > "Defense Configuration"
2. Select threat types to configure
3. Choose automatic or manual response
4. Set thresholds for automatic actions

> **Future Enhancement:** The customization interface for defensive responses is currently in development and will be available in a future update.
