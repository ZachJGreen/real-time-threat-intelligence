##	Project Overview

The purpose of the "Real-time Threat Intelligence (RTTI)" system is to track and identify cybersecurity threats in real time. The system detects possible dangers and provides useful insights to reduce risks by utilizing a mix of machine learning algorithms, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) technologies, and external APIs. Through real-time analysis and processing of massive amounts of data, this research aims to enhance proactive cybersecurity measures.

## Key Features
	Real-time threat monitoring and detection
	Integration with external OSINT APIs (Shodan, Have I Been Pwned, VirusTotal)
	Dynamic risk scoring powered by a Large Language Model (LLM)
	Interactive user interface for real-time intelligence display
	Data-driven risk assessment and mitigation suggestions

## Technologies Used
	Back-End: Node.js for server-side development
	Front-End: Vue.js for dynamic and responsive user interfaces
	Database: PostgreSQL for structured data storage
	OSINT Tools: Shodan, Have I Been Pwned, VirusTotal
	Machine Learning: Large Language Model (LLM) for risk scoring


	Team Members and Responsibilities

o	Project Manager: Morgan Sansone  
	Oversees project workflow, ensures deadlines are met, and coordinates team efforts.

o	OSINT Specialist: Zach Green  
	Researches and integrates OSINT tools and APIs for threat intelligence.

o	Risk Analyst: Luis Sanchez  
	Conducts threat and vulnerability assessments, risk mapping, and mitigation planning.

o	Developer: Maisha Islam  
	Implements back-end and front-end functionality for the RTTI system.

o	Documentation Lead: Hallee Pham  
	Manages project documentation, ensures clarity, and maintains version control.


	Installation


Prerequisites
	Node.js
