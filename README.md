# Real-time Threat Intelligence (RTTI)

## Project Overview

The purpose of the **Real-time Threat Intelligence (RTTI)** system is to track and identify cybersecurity threats in real time. The system detects possible dangers and provides useful insights to reduce risks by utilizing a mix of machine learning algorithms, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools, and external APIs. Through real-time analysis and processing of massive amounts of data, this research aims to enhance proactive cybersecurity measures.

## Key Features

- Real-time threat monitoring and detection
- Integration with external OSINT APIs (Shodan, Have I Been Pwned, VirusTotal)
- Dynamic risk scoring powered by a Large Language Model (LLM)
- Interactive user interface for real-time intelligence display
- Data-driven risk assessment and mitigation suggestions

## Technologies Used

- **Back-End**: Node.js for server-side development
- **Front-End**: Vue.js for dynamic and responsive user interfaces
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- **OSINT Tools**: Shodan, Have I Been Pwned, VirusTotal
- **Machine Learning**: Large Language Model (LLM) for risk scoring
